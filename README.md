# makenumber
make specific number with given numbers using four fundamental rules of calculation

For example,make 10 with 3,5,7,2,3 : 3\*5-7+2 =Â  10

This prongram will find solution by trying all patterns.

## frac class
class which enables fractions to being calculated

## calculate class
make calculation with operaters and given orders of operation

calculate() method will return an answer if all variable has proper value.
#### variables(arrays)
operator operators[n-1] operator(enum)
frac num[n] operand
bool minus[n] whether num has sign"-" (2:false,-1:true)
int calcOrder[n-1] calcOrder[0] indicates the place of operater
